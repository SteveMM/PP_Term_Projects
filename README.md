#####This assignment must be completed on a SHARCnet cluster using MPI C programming.Strict adherence to the SHARCNET etiquette (as per the course outline) is required.This Term Project is aimed at developing an efficient implementation of a parallel algorithm to com-pute the number of different elements in anNNmultiplication table.1  Statement of the problemAnNNmultiplication table is anNNarrayAdefined byAij=ij, fori; j= 1; : : : ; N.It is clear that anNNmultiplication table issymmetric, so we only need to worry about elementsabove the main diagonal.It is also clear that anNNmultiplication table has the squares 12, 22,: : :,N2as the elements ofits main diagonal.It can be seen that some elements above the main diagonal of anNNmultiplication table arerepeated.In order to quantify this (repetition) phenomenon, we define the following function:M(N) = # of different elements in anNNmultiplication matrix.2  To-do list and deliverables1.Verify by hand thatM(5) = 14.2.Verify by hand thatM(10) = 42.3.Design an efficient parallel algorithm to compute the functionM(N) for values ofNup to 105.4.Pay special attention to theload balancingissues that arise during the computation ofM(N).You will need to come up with an effective load balancing scheme, so that the work is as evenlydivided as possible between thepprocessors.5.Run your code on SHARCnet to compile a table of values of the functionM(N) forN= 5, 10,20, 40, 80, 160, 320, 640, 1000, 2000, 8000, 16000, 32000, 40000, 50000, 60000, 70000, 80000,90000, 100000.
